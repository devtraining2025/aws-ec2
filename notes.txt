I learned how to create an EC2 instance in AWS by choosing:
The operating system (Linux or Windows)

I learned how to connect my EC2 instance to my local computer using:
Terminal/CLI with SSH for Linux instances
.pem key file for authentication
Public IP address of the instance

3. Operating Systems: CLI and GUI

I learned about different operating systems used in EC2:
Linux (CLI-based) – commonly used in cloud environments
Windows (GUI-based) – used when graphical interface is needed
Red Hat Linux is widely preferred in enterprises because it offers paid customer support and certifications
