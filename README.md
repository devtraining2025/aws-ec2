# aws-ec2
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a virtual computer you can rent on AWS. You can choose the operating system, CPU, RAM, and storage for your EC2. To launch an EC2, select an AMI, choose an instance type, configure network and storage, set a security group, select a key pair, and click launch. Security Groups act as a firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Inbound rules define who can connect to your EC2, like SSH or HTTP, while outbound rules define where your EC2 can connect, like the internet. Public IP allows access from the internet, while private IP is for internal AWS network communication, and an Elastic IP gives your EC2 a fixed public IP. Instance types define CPU and memory, with Free Tier using t2.micro or t3.micro. Storage (EBS) is your EC2’s hard drive, which can be encrypted for security, and Linux instances are accessed via SSH, while Windows instances are accessed via RDP.
